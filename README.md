# MEnu
A weekly menu planner (coming soon, just let me finish the readme first)

## Purpose
To provide a quick way to plan your meals without the need to spend cognitive resources on marginally important decisions. Possibly with a user interface helping those who don't speak computer science fluently.

## Features
- Available dishes and ingredients are listed in an Excel file that the user can freely edit (please don't edit cells **bold** text);
- Ingredients can be combined according to user-defined criteria (somehow... almost... kind of);
- For each ingredient the user can set properties like
  - Does Alice like this? / Does Bob like this? (names can be customised)
  - Is this for all seasons or the cold/warm season?
  - Is this better for lunch or dinner?
- Avoid repeating the same meal twice in a row;
- Avoid repeating peculiar dishes more than once a week;
- Avoid not having pizza at least once, but not more than once, because my mum told me that (actually, the fact that at least once a week is guaranteed is enforced by statistical means: pizza has its own category);
- The user can set for all meals of all weekdays if Alice or Bob are present (so to pick only dishes they like);
- It works with a Tkinter GUI, but also as a console command (just run it to generate a men√π using the week number as seed);
- The source code is an obscene mix of English and Italian.
